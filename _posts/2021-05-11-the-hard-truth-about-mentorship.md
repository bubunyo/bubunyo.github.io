Many people who know me one way or the other know one thing i work tireless on is for new and upcoming devs to get mentored. This comes from a personal story. 

When i began with computers, in high school, the only resources i could consult were an old delphi bible, a unix bible, a generable purpose programming book and 2 other friends(Same Amoah and Victor Kumbol). Most of the things i picked up within the next 2 years were all from these resources. Fast forward to the university studying computer engineering and i was so happy at the fact that i was in a group where the average person knew more than i did and i was ready to learn from my peers. Or so I thought. I turns out, my peers all had exactly the same questions I had. So we hacked until we got answers. And sometimes for days. But we enjoyed the process. That alone was enough to keep us going. 

When i got out of uni and say the outside world, i was immidiately enthralled by all these guys who had been doing the things i so much wanted to do and had what seemed like the right answers to question i had had for years. What blew me away was the realization at the fact that if i had met these "seniors" about a year or two early the trajectory of my path would have been completely different and growth would look more like a hockey stick growth curve. That is also when it dawned on me that, new developers need mentorship and it was the only way through which we could build capable software engineering capacity. 5 years on and this realization has never been truer. 

Most new developers I have spoken to know they need mentorship and are often eager to get under the wings of a senior even if their time spent is not paid for. Most of them are often surprised when they realize nobody is willing to take them on even though they are ready to render free service. 

This is the hard truth about mentorship. 

I will not talk about what the structure of a mentorship should be albeit informal or not. I fear that is a conversation beyond the scope of this easy. 

The very thing new devs looking for mentorship fail to understand is that the cost involved in being under someones wing is not only how much you get paid. This even the least of the problems. The cost involved has more to do with the seniors underwhom you wan to understudy. Seniors are expensive and companies would rather spend money to have then do company work rather than mentor a junior who is not directly employed by the company. This means even if a senior does decide to mentor you, it is going to be in his downtime, and those hours I reckon are even more expensive. Time spent with you is time not spent with his family or loved ones or doing things that he would rather be doing. There are people who are fortunate to find seniors ready and willing to put in the effort to mentor them. If you ever fortunate to find a senio who is willing to put in all this effort for you, hold them in high regard, remain forever grateful and never dissapoint them. Remember you are one of the lucky few and dont forget to pay it forward. 

Where does that leave everybody else. The average joe out there will never find a dedicated mentor. That is not to say they should not be mentored. Infact, if you diassociate the notion of finding a mentor from that of being mentored you start to realize that mentorship can come in any form. The onus is on you to be able to effectivly utillize the mentorship channel availed to you.

And this is where DevCongress comes on. DevCongress is a free open to all, slack group that you can join by creating an invite for yourself. You can do that here. I strongly believe in DevCongresses ability to avail a channel through which individuals can get mentored. I have seen it play over countless times for numerous people including myself. Yes DevCongress is not perfect, neither is the world. But i believe everybody who is part of DevCongress is working strongly to make it a better place for everyone. Some times discussion get heated and can get personal, I think that demonstrates the passion in there more than anythig else. If you are willing to look past these imperfections identify where you need help, be bold enough to phrase your question, I trust you will never be dissapointed in the quality of your answers you get. Be it cyber security, (@finixbit has you covered), php (@silentworks has you covered), javascript, (@david has you covered) and everything inbetween, the community is ready to answer what ever question you have.

I believe there are two main reasons devcongress works as a mentorship channel. The first is we have an excellent community of seniors who are mostly online. The second and most important reason is the decentralized way with which we provide help. Anybody at anytime can chip in and answer a question at their own time. It being a 5 min break when an app is compiling or as a way to wind down in the evening. There is never pressure to check work and people can pick their own hours. I have realized this makes is easy for people to help even if the help drags on for a few hours.

If you are a developer within the African ecosystem, i entreat you to join DevCongress and be part of the community. You will be easily astonished at how much it will give back to you. I know cos it is still blowing me away.
